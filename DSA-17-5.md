## Aim

To Write a Python  program to print topological sorting of a DAG.

## Algorithm

1. Start the program.

2. Initialize Graph: Create an adjacency list adj for a graph with V = 6 vertices and initialize visited and departure arrays.

3. Add Edges: Use addEdge(u, v) to insert a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v.

4. DFS Traversal: Define DFS(v) to mark the current node v as visited, recursively visit all unvisited neighbors, and store the departure time of each node.

5. Track Departure Time: Use a global counter time to record the order in which vertices finish processing.

6. Topological Sort Function: In topologicalSort(), call DFS for each unvisited vertex to ensure all nodes are processed.

7. Print Topological Order: After DFS traversal, print vertices from departure[] in reverse order (from highest to lowest departure time).

8. Execute Program: Define edges of the DAG in main and call topologicalSort() to display the topological order of the graph.

9. stop the program.
    
## Program

```
# A Python3 program to print topological sorting of a DAG
def addEdge(u, v):
	global adj
	adj[u].append(v)

# The function to do DFS() and stores departure time
# of all vertex
def DFS(v):
	global visited, departure, time
	visited[v] = 1
	for i in adj[v]:
		if visited[i] == 0:
			DFS(i)
	departure[time] = v
	time += 1

# The function to do Topological Sort. It uses DFS().
def topologicalSort():
    for i in range(V):
        if (visited[i]==0):
            DFS(i)
    for i in range(V-1,-1,-1):
        print(departure[i],end=" ")
# Driver code
if __name__ == '__main__':

	# Create a graph given in the above diagram
	V,time, adj, visited, departure = 6, 0, [[] for i in range(7)], [0 for i in range(7)],[-1 for i in range(7)]
	addEdge(5, 2)
	addEdge(5, 0)
	addEdge(4, 0)
	addEdge(4, 1)
	addEdge(2, 3)
	addEdge(3, 1)

	print("Topological Sort of the given graph is")
	topologicalSort()

```
